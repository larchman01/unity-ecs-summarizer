## Unity ECS Summarizer
Simple Visual Studio extension that adds summaries to Unity ECS EntityQueries and ComponentTypeSets

## Examples
As of now, the extension can be used to display which components are (not) in the EntityQuery:
![EntityQuery Example](./Images//entity_query_example.PNG)

Or which components are contained in the ComponentTypeSet.
![ComponentTypeSet Example](./Images/component_set_example.PNG)

It is most useful with big queries or sets to quickly check which components they contain.
